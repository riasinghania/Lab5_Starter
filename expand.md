1. It's important to use meaningful and consistent IDs and classes because they're how CSS styles elements and how JavaScript selects and interacts with them. Clear naming makes your code easier to maintain, debug, and scale across technologies.
2. Data attributes store extra information in HTML using `data-* syntax`, like `data-user-id="123"`. They're useful for passing data to JavaScript without needing extra classes or IDs. You can access them in JS using `element.dataset.key`. They’re great for custom behaviors but aren't used for SEO or accessibility like microdata is.
3. A DOM fragment is a temporary, invisible container for elements. You can build multiple elements inside it and then add them to the real DOM all at once. This reduces performance costs by preventing repeated reflows and repainting in the browser.
4. The Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the real DOM used in frameworks like React. It helps by updating only the parts of the DOM that actually change, improving speed and performance. However, you lose direct control and some debugging simplicity.
5. In JavaScript, `class` is a reserved word (used to create classes), so you can’t use it as a property name. That’s why DOM elements use `className` to set or get CSS classes.
6. `addEventListener()` is more flexible because it lets you attach multiple event handlers to the same element and gives more control. `onClick` is simpler but only allows one function at a time, and it can get overwritten. Use `addEventListener()` for better long-term code.
